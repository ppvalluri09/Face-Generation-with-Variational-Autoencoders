# Face-Generation-with-Variational-Autoencoders

Generating new faces from the Celebrity Faces dataset using Variational Autoencoders. The model was trained on TESLA GPU on Google Colab for 100 epochs which took a little over 8 hours to train on a celebrity dataset consisting of around 200K images divided into mini-batches of 64. The images were scaled to a size of 50x50 with one color channel due to shotage of VRAM provided by google colab.
